## **Other Information**


**Non-Exempt Offer** Not applicable


This Termsheet has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in (a) any Member
State of the European Economic Area (" **EEA** ") will be made pursuant to an exemption under
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the " **Prospectus Regulation** ") from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes and (b) the United Kingdom (" **UK** ") will
be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the " **EUWA** ") (the “ **UK**
**Prospectus Regulation** and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended, the
“ **FSMA** ”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. Accordingly any
person making or intending to make an offer of Notes in (a) any Member State of the
European Economic Area which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this Termsheet
may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or the Dealer to
publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or to supplement a
prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to
such offer and (b) the United Kingdom which are the subject of the offering contemplated in

the Dealer to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the UK Prospectus Regulation or
section 85 of the FSMA or to supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the UK
Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer.


Neither the Issuer nor the Dealer has authorised, nor do they authorise, the making of any
offer of Notes in any other circumstances.

**Sales to EEA**
**Retail Investors**
**and UK Retail**
**Investors**



The Notes are not intended to be offered to any EEA retail investor in the European Economic
Area (“the EEA”) or any UK retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). Consequently, no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
"PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any EEA retail investor may be unlawful under the PRIIPS
Regulation. In addition, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
2018 (the “EUWA”) (as amended, the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any UK retail
investor may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPS Regulation.



**Valuation** BBVA intends, under normal conditions (as determined by BBVA in its sole discretion), to
publish an indicative price (dirty price) of the Notes on Bloomberg (with a Bid / Ask spread of
1%). These indicative prices will be published for information purposes only, and will not
constitute an offer to buy or sell any Notes nor a commitment to make such an offer.


Nevertheless, the first buyer of the Notes (the “ **Initial Buyer** ”) shall have the right to request
from BBVA a firm purchase price of the Notes owned by the Initial Buyer (the “ **Firm Price** ”) for
a minimum aggregate amount of 1,000 GBP and subject to normal market and funding
conditions (as determined by BBVA in its sole discretion) The Firm Price shall be calculated
by BBVA in its sole discretion. Any Firm Price provided by BBVA shall lose its binding
character for BBVA if not immediately accepted by the Initial Buyer upon communication to it
without the imposition of any terms and conditions by the Initial Buyer.
